| `/kick` | `target` | `/kick target:@Tyrelius#0001` | Select a member and kick them (but not really). |
| `/options-info` | `input` | `/options-info input:This is an example.` | Information about the options provided. |
| `/ping` | - | `/ping` | Replies with Pong! |
| `/prune` | `amount` | `/prune amount:10` | Prune up to 99 messages. |
| `/server` | - | `/server` | Display info about this server. |
| `/user-info` | - | `/user-info` | Display info about yourself. |

    secrets:
      - token
      - clientId
      - guildId
secrets:
